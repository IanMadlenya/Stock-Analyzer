Description of the program
The Stock Analyzer is a financial tool used to aid in an investor’s analysis of certain stocks. This tool can be used to analyze price trends and apply algorithmic trading strategies to historic stock prices. This program utilizes many features which include:

•	Using Google Finance’s API in order to analyze historical stock prices.

•	Constructing lines of best fit for trend analysis.

•	Creating a correlation coefficient for past price trends.

•	Creating and applying a Simple Moving Average (SMA) Algorithmic Trading Strategy.

•	Displaying historical stock prices, holding periods, a 5-day and 20-day SMA and cash levels which illustrate trading algorithm’s results. 

•	A return label with colour–coded display (red for loss and green for a gain).

•	A colour–coded legend describing the lines that are drawn.

•	Horizontal axis lines which illustrate the minimum, maximum and midpoint prices for the period.

•	Vertical axis lines which illustrate the performance of the stock in each year.

The program has two main analysis options:
1.	Trend Analysis: Constructs a trend line and determines the correlation strength for the chosen stock’s historical prices over the chosen time period. 

2.	Algorithmic Trading Analysis: Applies the SMA trading algorithm to the chosen stock’s historical prices over the chosen time period.
